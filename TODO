Bugfixes:  
  ✔ mode selection allows "-" selector (+ option below) @done(18-06-29 18:13)
  ☐ hide "option restriction setting" when not appropriate (showWhen doesn't work for selectAlternatives for some reason)
    possibly bug in H5P core library
  ✘ line-height doesn't work in selection mode @cancelled(18-08-03 23:28)
  ✔ snippets are always in their own paragraph (because they are html elements and receive a paragraph around them) @done(18-06-02 20:36)
  ✘ you can press "Check" in Selection mode even if nothing has been selected so far @cancelled(18-06-02 20:38)

General todo:
  ☐ check behavior of content type when used in...
    ☐ Course Presentation
    ☐ Question Set
    ☐ other aggregates?
  ✔ check state storage mechanism: is the current state fully saved & restored? @done(18-08-03 23:30)
  ✔ make sure semantics naming is consistent with other H5P libraries @done(18-07-07 17:59)
  ✔ very long selection / textareas are clipped if they go out of bounds @done(18-06-02 20:58)
  Firefox 57: 
    Safari iOS 11 on iPhone and iPad:
      ✘ typing mode: error indicator overlaps with text @cancelled(18-06-29 17:02) not reproducable
      - typing mode: when there's a popup, the reference element should be focussed (still needed?)
      ✔ typing mode: the color of correctly solved gaps are wrong (the text is much too light) @done(18-06-29 17:02)
      ✔ typing mode: the alignment of the (in)correct symbol is broken: it's too far up (minor issue) @done(18-06-29 17:02)
      - typing mode: the cursor is visible on top of popups if they overlap (happens a lot)      
    Chrome / Samsung Internet on Android (Samsung Galaxy S7):
      - typing mode: part of the cursor is visible on top of popups if they overlap (happens a lot, not as ugly as on iOS)
      - clipping of popups (small amount, no content clipped) in certain cases
      - highlight of text + textarea directly below --> no space between them
      - popup and textarea / select should be focussed when popup is shown
    Edge 41 + Internet Explorer 10/11:
      - highlight blink animation doesn't work
      - select mode: when selecting an option, all options in the list are displayed with the in/correct style (displayed only for a short time)
    only Edge 41:
      - hover over correct symbol: textbox select cursor displayed (instead of none)
      - big left margin for select boxes      
      - typing mode: hint button aligned to the bottom      
    only Internet Explorer 10/11:
      - select mode: UI override of select boxes doesn't work: displays chevron (a problem if there is a hint, because it is on top of the in/correct symbol)
      - select mode: correct answer: text too light (dark gray), not an issue in typing mode           
      - typing mode: textbox calculation too small

Low priority:
=============
☐ give smart UI hints: Esc + Enter button, Tab when not used
☐ It would be useful to have a text pasting option that accepts regular blanks.
    This is rather complicated as the "widgets" attribute is not implemented for groups, only for lists. The easiest way might be to extend
    the H5P core for groups to have the "widgets" attribute! (this would be done by changing the inheritance structure of the group editor widget to
    derive from SemanticStructure and by finding out what the default editor widget for group would be)
☐ take over accessibility from h5p-blanks
☐ auto-growing text-fields
☐ hover over image --> no tooltip (bug in h5p library?)
☐ feedback popup is too large --> auto-size

Far future:
===========

☐ It would be useful to have an inbuilt language intelligence that can deal with typical issues:
      ☐ wrongly used apostrophes: ´` instead of '
      ☐ auto-alternatives for short forms (with option to disable it); requires intelligent checking of what is before the gap to avoid weird short forms like "Chris's done that before."
      ☐ auto-feedback for irregular verbs and typical misspellings
      ☐ autogeneration of incorrect answers for tenses which the content creator can select + generic auto-feedback texts defined by the user.
      ☐ autogeneration of incorrect answers for plural / singular

(re)consider if needed:
=======================

☐ react to resize event + send them when appropriate
☐ new setting: allow further editing after 'check' / disallow
☐ sanatise all user entered strings
☐ replace ractive with jquery views
☐ add highlight for hints
☐ hide tip icon if blank was answered correctly
☐ show "check" button in auto-answer mode when last gap is being filled (to avoid confusion of what to do at the end; user might not be aware of the concept of "losing focus")
☐ auto-check in select mode: does this work with keyboard select?
☐ if correct answer is: "Correct 1" and user enters "Correct " it is not considered a spelling mistake

done log:
=========
  ✔ fix feedback popup positioning @done(18-01-14 11:54)
  ✔ feedback popup sometimes is shifted to the wrong position if buttons become visible (reason is that its position is set as relative to the bottom, which changes after the popup was positioned) @done(18-01-14 11:54)
  ✔ resizing of screen -> no repositioning @done(18-01-14 11:54)
  ✔ check if resize events are called and handled correctly @done(18-01-14 11:54)

  ✔ dropdown icon is on top of other icons
  ✔ blank should revert to "neutral" state when it was wrong and is opened
  ✔ bug: empty selection --> line is too high

  ✘ show +1 / -1 score calculator
  ✔ simplify highlight markup in semantics (for incorrectAnswers)
  ✔ popup for (i) icon when notifying of surpressed popups?  
  ✔ Alternative markup should be / instead of ; to align the content with the normal h5p content type. @done(17-12-27 21:52)
  ✔ It would be useful to have HTML markup in feedback texts. @done(17-12-31 11:47)

    ✔ Answer mode should become a regular option. @done(17-12-30 14:07)
  ✔ Line height should not be 1.0. The touching boxes look bad. @done(17-12-31 11:20)
  ✔ was not/wasn't --> only was not is accepted as solution (it's not an issue with alternatives, though. It's must be about the apostrophe.) @done(17-12-27 21:52)

  ✘ select box / input box not long enough for long input --> overlap with symbols @cancelled(17-12-31 11:51)

  ✔ consider auto-growing boxes and block alignment to avoid "combing" on small screens @done(18-01-19 17:48)
  ✔ selection boxes have a strange border on the right (probably an artifact of -moz-appearance: button; which doesn't work, see firefox_select.png + firefox_select_2.png) @done(18-01-19 17:24)
  ✔ typing mode: auto-capitalization of gaps @done(18-01-10 21:17)
  ✔ select & typing mode: overlap of text with symbols in selection boxes with hints and incorrect answer (overlap1.png) @done(18-01-13 16:22)
  ✔ hover over hint button: textbox select cursor instead of "hand" cursor displayed (in select mode) @done(18-01-10 21:07)
  ✔ typing mode: the textbox displays a "clear" button it is not correctly aligned to the right because of the space for the incorrect / correct symbol; can this be hidden? the h5p blanks content type doesn't have this issue) @done(18-01-10 21:07)
  ✔ select mode: think of better way of showing feedback than reopening the drop down menu @done(18-01-19 18:26)
